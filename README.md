# My-Glucometer
My Glucometer is a web app that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on their medical data. The machine learning model, trained using Logistic Regression in Jupyter Notebook, is deployed via Flask. The model was serialized using Pickle, allowing for real-time predictions on the web.
