# My Glucometer - Diabetes Prediction Model

## Overview

**My Glucometer** is a web-based application that predicts whether a patient is diabetic based on input medical attributes. The machine learning model behind the app is trained using Logistic Regression and is deployed using Flask for a seamless user experience.

## Features

- Predicts diabetes based on user input data such as glucose levels, BMI, etc.
- Real-time predictions with user-friendly web interface.
- Machine learning model trained on medical data using Logistic Regression.
- Deployed with Flask for easy access via a web browser.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for model development and web app.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for model training and experimentation.
- **Logistic Regression**: Machine learning algorithm used for prediction.
- **Flask**: Web framework for deployment.
- **Pickle**: For model serialization and loading.
